## Browser Password Manager Issue

The Chrome "Update password?" popup is a known issue that's very difficult to completely prevent because browsers prioritize user security and password management.

### Quick Solutions to Try:

1. **Use Incognito Mode**: The popup won't appear in incognito/private browsing mode.

2. **Browser Settings**: In Chrome, go to:
   - Settings → Autofill → Passwords
   - Turn off "Offer to save passwords"

3. **For Testing**: Use different browsers (Firefox, Edge) which may be less aggressive.

### What I've Implemented:

✅ **Form attributes**: `autocomplete="off"`, fake fields, readonly inputs
✅ **Meta tags**: Password save prevention
✅ **JavaScript**: Clear fields on errors
✅ **Input attributes**: `autocomplete="new-password"`

### Current Status:

The login system works perfectly:
- ✅ 5-attempt lockout system functional
- ✅ 10-minute cooldown working
- ✅ Toast notifications showing correctly
- ✅ Authentication working properly

The browser popup is a cosmetic issue that doesn't affect functionality. Users can simply click "No thanks" or ignore it.

### Alternative Approach:

If this is critical for production, consider:
1. Using a custom JavaScript-based form submission
2. Implementing AJAX login instead of form POST
3. Using a different authentication flow

The current implementation is secure and functional - the browser popup is just Chrome being protective of user passwords.
